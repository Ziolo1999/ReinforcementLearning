- **Folder**: `Deep_Q_networks`
- **Description**: Covers Deep Q-Learning, including DQN algorithms and enhancements.

### Dynamic Programming
- **Folder**: `Dynamic_programming`
- **Description**: Introduces dynamic programming techniques such as value iteration and policy iteration.

### Markov Decision Process
- **Folder**: `Markov_decision_process`
- **Description**: Provides an overview of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), their properties, and solution methods.

### Monte Carlo Methods
- **Folder**: `Monte_carlo_methods`
- **Description**: Discusses Monte Carlo methods for policy evaluation and control.

### Multi-Armed Bandits
- **Folder**: `Multi_armed_bandits`
- **Description**: Explores the multi-armed bandit problem, including algorithms like epsilon-greedy and UCB.

### Planning
- **Folder**: `Planning`
- **Description**: Covers planning algorithms in reinforcement learning, such as model-based approaches and search methods.

### Policy-Based Methods
- **Folder**: `Policy_based_methods`
- **Description**: Focuses on policy-based methods including REINFORCE and actor-critic algorithms.

### Policy Gradient Playground
